1. How does a country's GDP relate to itâ€™s CO2 emissions? (Maya > Jayden) 
- - Globally how have CO2 emissions and GDP changed over the years (CO2 emissions vs GDP globally per year graph)

By first plotting the average C02 emissions globally per year, as well as GDP per year (as seen in [Analysis3](notebooks/analysis3.ipynb)), we were able to see that these changes did not necessarily reflect each other. One might assume that C02 emissions would rise as GDP rose, but the graph below - made by combining the global C02 and GDP graphs - shows otherwise.

- - Comparing the 10 countries with highest GDP with the bottom 10 countries with lowest GDP
- - Finally exploring how the data relates

2. Which countries (if any) have reduced their annual C02 emissions within the last 30 years? (1990-2019). By how much? Did this affect their economy (GDP)? (Jayden)

Using a method to sort the countries found in [Analysis3](notebooks/analysis3.ipynb), We were able to determine the 10 countries who had improved their C02 emissions the most (More than 10 would have been too many to graph). We then used line plots to visualize how the emissions of each of these countries had changed.

After this, we could search for these 10 countries in the GDP dataset, and present them on a similar graph. However, the GDP dataset only contained information from 2005 onward for many countries, so the range of the x-axis is smaller in this graph.

Even considering the difference in the axis, you can determine that as the emissions tend downwards (or rarely upwards) for these countries, the GDP stays relatively stagnant, without much variation. Therefore, one could assume that these economies were not negatively affected by the decrease in emissions.
 
3. Is GDP in any way related to a country's owned forest area (Shila)
