## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Coming from technical background, each group member of this project have high interest in understanding climate change and how it compares to countries with different GDPS and different amount of forest area shared. We are interested in finding out how CO2 emission is co-related to GDP and forest area shared from our dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our dataset focuses on greenhouse gas emission (CO2 in particular), GDP and forest area shared by countries globally. We have three different datasets combined together which are on global Carbon-dioxide emission, global GDP and global share forest area. The dataset has datas collected on these 3 different topics from year 1990-2019 for 195 countries.
