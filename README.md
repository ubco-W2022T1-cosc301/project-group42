## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Global warming is becoming a bigger and bigger threat to our earth, for this reason we think it’s important to analyze one of the biggest contributors to global warming, CO2 emissions. As well as the factors that impact CO2 emissions such as our world forest area and GDP. 

Coming from a technical background, each group member of this project has a high interest in understanding how CO2 emissions compare with countries with different GDPs and different amount of forest area shared. Some questions we want to explore are: 

- Which countries (if any) have reduced their annual C02 emissions within the last 15 years?

- How does the correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions compare in third world countries vs first world countries? Do these correlations hold during financial crises periods?

(More can be found in our separate jupyter notebooks)

We hope we can bring attention to the issue of rising CO2 emissions with our analytics project, and emphasize the importance of forests in fighting climate change. We can definitely imagine building a dashboard with our dataset. We think pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs would work great to display our data to others. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We have three different datasets which focus on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 in particular) world wide, GDP per country and forest area shared by countries globally. 
We plan to combine these data sets based on country and year. All of our datasets have data collected on these 3 different topics from the years 1990 to 2019, for 195 countries.
The dataset regarding forest area, obtained it’s data from the United Nations (UN) food and agriculture organization who used satellite imagery, remote sensing, and country reports to collect data. The GDP data and the CO2 emissions data was obtained from the worldbank. In general GDP is calculated by each country’s government. The CO2 emissions were calculated on the available data on fossil fuel consumptions provided by the UN.

The CO2 emissions data was collected to help world leaders be aware of how much CO2  their country emits and to help scientists further study the relationship between CO2 and global warming. The GDP data was collected to study the economic situation of each country for a specific year. The forest area data was collected to keep a historical record of the world’s forests.
